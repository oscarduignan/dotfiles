## Create Public GIST To Share

By default, it creates secret GIST so only you can see it but if you want to share your GIST with other users, you can set it to public.
You can't change the exiting GIST type from secret to public so it will reset the GIST ID so you can create new GIST with all the existing editor settings.

Select Command **"Sync : Advance Options > Public / Private GIST Mode & Reset GIST"**

## Fetch Other User's Settings

You may give the GIST ID to other users , your friends or employees so they download each of the extensions or settings you upload but they cant edit your GIST or upload anything on your GIST.

Select Command **"Sync : Advance Options > Fetch Other User's Settings"**
